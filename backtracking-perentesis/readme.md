This algorythm is used to solve the parentheses challange.

The combination that contains 1 type of parentheses is valid if every opening parentheses has its closing parentheses, and it doesn't have a closing parentheses without having an unused opening parentheses befre it.

Invalid parentheses:
```
()(()()
()(()))(())
```

Valid:
```
()((()))(())
```
